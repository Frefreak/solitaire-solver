# Overview
Solver for solitaire minigame in Shenzhen I/O.

Currently it just works, but needs furthur improvements:

- there are some glitchs prevent it from playing a series of games (possibly `monitor` side problem)
- the solver uses dfs and generates not the most efficient solution
- mouse movement can be smoother
